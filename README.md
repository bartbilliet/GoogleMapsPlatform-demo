# GoogleMapsPlatform-demo
Some small tests on the Google Maps Platform:

1. **[Fixed marker on map](1_MarkerOnMap)**<br />
Small Hello World by adding a *hardcoded* marker to a Google Maps, embedded in a webpage. 

2. **[Markers from external GeoJSON data on map](2_MarkersFromJsonOnMap)**<br />
Map out [usgs.gov earthquake data](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes) as markers on Google Maps (in [GeoJSON format](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)). 
The data shows all M2.5+ earthquakes in the last 7 days worldwide. 

3. **[Weighted heatmap from external GeoJSON data on map](3_HeatmapFromJsonOnMap)**<br />
Heatmap from [usgs.gov earthquake data](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes), where earthquake magnitude is represented as weights on Google Maps (in [GeoJSON format](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)). 
The data shows all M2.5+ earthquakes in the last 7 days worldwide.
